## Who are we?
We are a Waste Management Company.

## Goal?
Our goal is to maximize the quantity of waste.

## How it Works

* 8 AM
The residents compare utility functions and decide their garbage disposal destinations.

* 9 AM – 2 PM
Each resident chooses a random time during this period and walk from home to his/her garbage disposal destination. When the resident is not on the trip to dispose of garbage, he/she will be walking around town. When spotting someone dumping on streets, he/she will decide whether to take a photo and post online.

* 10 AM – 4 PM
The waste transport workers are driving the vehicles around to pick up garbage. Between 12 NOON – 1 PM the workers take lunch break.

* 5 PM
The total waste transported on the day is calculated and revenue and costs are calculated.

## Waste disposal and options
Each resident disposes of 15 liters of garbage daily, at some time between 9 AM and 2 PM. Each day the resident makes a decision on the destination, which can be

* The designated trash bin in his/her neighborhood

* One of the street dump sites
